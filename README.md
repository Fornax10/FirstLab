The Warthog
=====

 Once upon a time a warthog wandered so far from his home and family that he came to the big wide ocean. 
 
 "Have you ever seen so much water!" he thought happily after being parched by the hot sun on his long walk across the savannah. "I'll have a long good drink and tell the others! They will be so releived." he thought as all the wadis back home were bone dry and now muddy  waterhole shrunk every passing day.
